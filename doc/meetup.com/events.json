The group is based on the belief that parents learn best from other parents. Books help - but parents are the real deal. The talks we have with others in the park, at a playdate or during a child's soccer game are where we find strategies that have worked for others and gain insight into common concerns. This group has been created to provide a consistent, open and respectful community of like-minded parents to share, find wisdom and laugh a bit together.\n\nCome and talk about your joys and struggles as parents of toddlers and pre-school children. Find strategies that relate to your individual child and unique circumstance. There is often more than one solution to any challenge or problem. Come meet others who have ideas and experiences that can support you! Ask questions, learn from others and find support in this parenting group.\n\nThis is a 1 hour topic driven discussion/support group for parents of young children (ages 2 - 5).

Nearly 30,000 new products are introduced each year, and 95% of them fail, according to Clayton Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business School.
